                      The Edukquake is a vulnerability mapping system designed for public elementary schools in Dinalupihan, Bataan. It can be used as database to identify if a building is in low, moderate, and high susceptibility in terms of potential seismic hazard.<br>  

                      <br>Along with the map, a general information which includes the name of the school, distance from the nearest fault line, distance from the west valley fault, and no. of school buildings were also displayed when viewing a certain school. A total of 33 public elementary schools with a total of 224 school buildings were able to be assessed by the team during the course of their study.<br> 
                      
                      <br>The Edukquake was inspired by HazardHunter and FaultFinder in terms of it objective in locating hazards in specific areas. This website is the product the collective effort of the team with the help of the Department of Science and Technologyâ€™s (DOST) thesis fund for scholars.

                    <h2>Mission</h2>
                    <p class="p-5">To enhance the safety and preparedness of public elementary schools in Dinalupihan, Bataan through seismic vulnerability mapping and assessment. The Edukquake system aims to provide information on the susceptibility of school buildings to potential seismic hazards. By empowering school administrators and community stakeholders with critical data through the implementation of local government unit, we strive to mitigate risks, improve emergency response, and ensure the well-being of students and staff in the event of an earthquake.</p>

                    <p class="pt-5">EdukQuake was made possible through the meticulous assessment of each school building by the Civil Engineering students by utilizing the FEMA-154 guidelines. The project was guided by the expertise of Engineer Sam Olarte, Engineer Ranier Santos, and Engineer Meeko Masangcap. The website was developed by Mr. Neil Leonard Acuna. The assessments were thoroughly reviewed and certified by Municipal Engineering Ofiice - Dinalupihan, Provincial Engineering Office - Bataan, and Department of Public Works and Highway - 1st Distict.</p>
